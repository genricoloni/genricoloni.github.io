        <p>4 >> If you're reading this, welcome! I decided to start this little journey mostly for my own pleasure, specifically to have a (safe) place where I can write about my thoughts, my projects, and my experiences.
            Few words about myself: I'm a MD student in Pisa, Italy, attending the Computer Engineering course, with some in-depth exams about Cybersecurity. I don't really like web development (you can probably got that looking at the website): instead, I'm more interested in Computer Architecture and low-level software security (binary exploitation with Ghidra and stuff like this).
            I suffer from a severe case of impostor syndrome, so I'm not really confident about my skills, and I'm absolutely unable to accept any kind of compliment. I'm also a bit of a perfectionist, so I'm never satisfied with my work, and I'm always looking for ways to improve it.
            I'm really inspired by the Open Source community, and I'd really like to improve my skill (and my confidence) to the point where I can contribuite to some projects. Obviously, I'm a Linux user (Arch, btw), not only because of my philosophical beliefs, but also because I'm a bit of a masochist. Jokes aside, I love the possibility to customize everything, learning how the system works, and the community.

            If you want to know more about me, or if you want to talk about something, feel free to contact me! I'm always happy to meet new people and to learn new things. I'm also open to any kind of suggestion about the website, or about the content of the posts. I'm not a native English speaker, so I'm sure there are a lot of mistakes in my writing. I'm always looking for ways to improve, so feel free to correct me: my email is genrico.loni+gh at gmail dot com!
