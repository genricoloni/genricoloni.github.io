        <h1>3 >> SpotifySyncWall into deep - 1</h1>
        <p>4 >> Let me start saying that this project is the perfect representation of myself during my typical workflow: I've an idea about a certain thing I can add to my setup, I can't find anything even closer and then build that thing all on my own.
            SpotifySyncWall was born in these very conditions: I was looking for a simple script that can dynamically modify  my wallpaper based on the song I was listening to in Spotify. 
            Full of hope I started my research trough GNOME extensions, the web and the entire Github database, but I found nothing that could satisfy my needs. In fact, I found a repo that has been abandoned for almost a year, with a basic login structure to spotify and a simple script to generate and change the wallpaper.
            As a strong independent Linux user, I cannot be satisfied with a uncompleted project, so I decide to take the matter into my own hands, fork the repo and start working on it.
            I don't really want to go into the technical details of my implementation (I promise I'll do it in a future post): I simply had the need to write down about my real first autonomous project, for my very own pleasure, and I'd lie if I say that I'm not proud of it: I hope this could be the first of many projects I'll be able to complete and share with the community.
